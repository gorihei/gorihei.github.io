# Building Accessible Web Applications

A practical guide to creating web applications that are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Web accessibility ensures that websites and applications are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. It's not just the right thing to do - it's often a legal requirement.

## Key Principles (WCAG)

### 1. Perceivable
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

### 2. Operable
User interface components and navigation must be operable.

### 3. Understandable
Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.

### 4. Robust
Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Practical Tips

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Make keyboard navigation possible
- Use ARIA labels appropriately

## Testing Tools

- axe DevTools
- WAVE browser extension
- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

## Conclusion

Building accessible web applications is essential for creating an inclusive web experience for all users.
