# Case Study: E-Commerce Platform Redesign

How we improved conversion rates by 40% through a complete redesign and performance optimization of an e-commerce platform.

## The Challenge

Our client's e-commerce platform was experiencing:
- High bounce rates (65%)
- Low conversion rates (1.2%)
- Slow page load times (5+ seconds)
- Poor mobile experience

## Our Approach

### 1. Performance Optimization

We implemented:
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Code splitting and tree shaking
- CDN integration
- Server-side rendering

### 2. UX Redesign

Key improvements:
- Simplified checkout process (3 steps instead of 5)
- Improved product search and filtering
- Better mobile navigation
- Clearer call-to-action buttons

### 3. A/B Testing

We tested multiple variations of:
- Product page layouts
- Checkout flows
- Color schemes
- CTA button text

## Results

After 3 months:
- **40% increase** in conversion rate (1.2% â†’ 1.68%)
- **35% reduction** in bounce rate (65% â†’ 42%)
- **60% faster** page load times (5s â†’ 2s)
- **25% increase** in mobile conversions

## Key Learnings

1. Performance matters: Every second of load time affects conversions
2. Simplify the user journey: Fewer steps = more conversions
3. Mobile-first is essential: 70% of traffic came from mobile
4. Test everything: Data-driven decisions outperform assumptions

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the powerful impact of combining performance optimization with thoughtful UX design.
