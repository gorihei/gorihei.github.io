# State Management in Vue 3

Deep dive into state management patterns in Vue 3, comparing Pinia, Vuex, and the Composition API approach.

## Introduction

State management is crucial for building scalable Vue applications. Vue 3 offers multiple approaches, each with its own strengths.

## Pinia: The Official Store

Pinia is now the officially recommended state management solution for Vue 3. It offers:

- Intuitive API
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Devtools integration
- Modular design

```javascript
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

export const useCounterStore = defineStore('counter', {
  state: () => ({
    count: 0
  }),
  actions: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    }
  }
})
```

## Vuex 4

While Pinia is recommended, Vuex 4 is still supported for Vue 3:

- Battle-tested
- Familiar API for existing projects
- Good for migration scenarios

## Composition API Approach

For simpler applications, the Composition API with `reactive()` and `provide/inject` can be sufficient:

```javascript
const state = reactive({
  user: null,
  isAuthenticated: false
})
```

## Which to Choose?

- **Pinia**: New projects or those needing modern features
- **Vuex**: Existing projects with Vuex
- **Composition API**: Simple apps with minimal state

## Conclusion

Choose the state management solution that best fits your project's needs and complexity.
